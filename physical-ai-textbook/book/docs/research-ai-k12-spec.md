You are a spec-generation agent. Produce a single, self-contained specification document for a research paper project and format it as a Markdown file with YAML front-matter suitable for Spec-Kit Plus. The file must be thorough and machine-readable so other agent commands (sp.implement.md / sp.tasks.md) can consume it. Project summary: - Title: "AI's Impact on K-12 Classroom Efficiency" - Short description: Produce a 3,000–5,000 word, evidence-backed research paper for education administrators evaluating AI adoption, focused on teacher workload reduction and student outcome improvements. - Primary target audience: Education administrators and policy makers evaluating AI adoption in K-12 settings. YAML front-matter (at top of the file) must include: - id (slug-like): ai-impact-k12 - title - owner: (leave as placeholder) - priority: high - estimate_days: 14 - created: (use today's date in ISO format) - type: research-paper - deliverables: list of main artifacts (markdown paper, references.bib, README summary, slides.md) - tags: research, education, AI, K-12 Body content requirements (all as Markdown sections): 1. Goals & Success Criteria - Explicitly list the success criteria provided: - Identifies 3+ concrete AI applications with evidence - Cites 8+ peer-reviewed academic sources (≤10 years) - Reader can explain ROI after reading - All claims supported by evidence - Add measurable acceptance tests for each criterion (how to verify). 2. Scope & Constraints - Word count: 3000–5000 words - Format: Markdown with APA-style inline citations and full APA references section - Sources: Peer-reviewed journals only, published within past 10 years - Timeline: Complete within 14 calendar days from spec acceptance - Explicit "Not in scope" list: - Comprehensive literature review of the entire AI field - Comparison of specific AI products/vendors - Discussion of ethical concerns (separate paper) - Implementation guide or code examples 3. Deliverables - Primary paper: `paper.md` (markdown, APA citations) - References file: `references.bib` or `references.md` in APA - Executive summary: `README_SUMMARY.md` (≤500 words) - Submission-ready folder structure and metadata (list) - Optional: `slides.md` or `slides.pdf` for a 5-slide pitch 4. Acceptance Criteria & Tests - For each success criterion, provide specific tests and pass/fail conditions: - e.g., "At least 3 AI applications identified: check list and each has ≥1 peer-reviewed citation; each claim references an inline citation." - "≥8 peer-reviewed sources: count and list DOIs; confirm publication date within 10 years." - "ROI explanation: contains numeric or qualitative ROI framework (cost drivers, benefit drivers) and a worked example." - "All claims supported: every assertion with a citation or data source; highlight any uncited claims as TODO." 5. Content Structure (Suggested Outline) - Title page + abstract (≤250 words) - Introduction & problem statement - Methodology (search strategy and inclusion criteria) - 3+ case studies / application areas (each 500–900 words) - Evidence synthesis and ROI framework - Discussion (limitations; short note referencing ethics paper) - Conclusion & recommendations for administrators - References (APA) 6. Research & Sources Strategy - Provide exact search queries for Google Scholar, PubMed, ERIC, IEEE Xplore, and Scopus that target K-12, classroom efficiency, teacher workload reduction, and AI interventions. Example queries (provide 8–12). - Recommended journals & conferences to prioritize (short list). - Inclusion/exclusion rules for selecting papers (peer-reviewed, within 10 years, empirical studies preferred, K-12 subset). 7. File targets & paths (what the implementer should create) - `.specify/research-ai-k12.spec.md` (this file) - `research/paper.md` - `research/references.bib` - `research/README_SUMMARY.md` - `research/slides.md` - `research/data/sources_list.md` (list of candidate papers with DOI and short note) - `research/tasks/` (issue templates or task checklists) 8. Task Breakdown (atomic tasks) - Provide a prioritized list of tasks (title, description, owner:Agent/Human, estimate in hours, dependencies). Include at least 12 tasks covering search, reading, draft writing, citation curation, ROI calculation, review, and finalization. 9. Timeline / Milestones (2-week plan) - Day 1: finalize spec & search queries - Days 2–4: literature search & collect 30 candidate papers - Days 5–7: read & annotate top 12 papers; draft case study outlines - Days 8–10: write main paper draft (sections) - Day 11: internal review & citations check - Day 12: revise for ROI section and evidence synthesis - Day 13: final edit, APA formatting, generate references - Day 14: package submission artifacts and create slides 10. Review Checklist (for final QA) - Word count check - Citation count and DOI list - APA formatting check - Acceptance criteria checklist (pass/fail) - Plagiarism confidence (agent note: run a check if possible) 11. Risks & Mitigations - Risk: insufficient peer-reviewed sources within 10 years → Mitigation: widen search to include closely related K-12 studies, or include high-quality conference proceedings - Risk: ROI data paucity → Mitigation: build qualitative ROI framework and a hypothetical worked example 12. Example commit message and branch name - commit: `research: add initial spec and literature search plan` - branch: `feat/research-ai-k12-spec` 13. Output format requirements - Provide the entire file as one Markdown document with clear headings, bullet lists, code blocks where appropriate (for search queries), and the YAML front-matter at the top. - Include a short JSON block at the end with a machine-friendly summary: ```json { "id":"ai-impact-k12", "title":"AI's Impact on K-12 Classroom Efficiency", "estimate_days":14, "tasks": [ {"title":"...","estimate_hours":...}, ... ] } ``` 14. Extra: produce a short ready-to-paste prompt for a later Claude Code run that will perform the literature search and return top 12 candidate papers with DOIs (include exact search queries and filters). Include this prompt at the end of the spec. Tone: clear, precise, actionable. Do not actually perform web searches — only produce the spec and the search queries. Return only the Markdown spec content (including YAML front-matter and the JSON summary block at the end). Do not add any commentary outside the spec.
